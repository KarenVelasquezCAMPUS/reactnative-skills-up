# reactnative-skills-up

This repository contains various projects and practice files created to learn and improve my skills in React Native. Each project is designed to explore different aspects of React Native development, including navigation, state management, UI design, and integration with external libraries.

Projects
Navigation: Examples of different navigation patterns using React Navigation, including bottom tabs, stack navigation, and drawer navigation.
State Management: Demonstrations of state management techniques using hooks, Context API, and Redux.
UI Components: Implementations of custom UI components and layouts, styled with Tailwind CSS and other libraries.
Charts and Data Visualization: Practice with data visualization using libraries like react-native-svg-charts to create interactive charts and graphs.
Feel free to explore the projects, learn from the code, and contribute with your own ideas and improvements. Happy coding!****
